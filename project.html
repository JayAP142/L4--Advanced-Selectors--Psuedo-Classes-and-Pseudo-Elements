    <h1 class="h">The Solar System</h1> 
    <p>The solar system is the system of celestial bodies gravitationally bound to the Sun. Many stars alongside our sun have solar systems due to the bodies that orbit around it. The solar system the Earth belongs to consists of eight planets, five dwarf planets, the sun, the asteroid belt, meteors and comets in the Oort Cloud. </p> <br>

    <h2 class="h">The Sun</h2>
    1. Makes up 99% of the total mass of the solar system <br>
    2. The Sun has a gravitational force that spans 9 billion km long and 4.5 billion wide.<br>
    3. It is fuelled by the nuclear fusion of Hydrogen and Helium
    4. It's diameter is 1.4 million km<br>

    <h2 class="h">The Planets</h2>
    1. There are eight planets namely Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune<br>
    2. Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars are <strong><em>Terrestrial Planets</em></strong> whilst Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune are <strong><em>Jovian Planets</em></strong><br>
    3. Jovian Planets are grouped into two: <mark>Gas Giants</mark>(Jupiter and Saturn) and <mark>Ice Giants</mark>(Uranus and Neptune)<br>
    4. The planets were named after Roman gods<br>
    5. <em>Venus</em> is the hottest and <em>Neptune</em> is the coldest<br>
    6.<u>Mercury</u> has the shortest revolution and <u>Jupiter</u> has the shortest rotation on its axis.<br>
    7. <strong>Venus</strong> and <strong>Uranus</strong> rotate clockwise whilst the rest rotate counter-clockwise<br>
8. Jupiter is the largest planet<br>
9. Only Earth supports life<br>

<h2 class="h">The Dwarf Planets</h2>
1. The dwarf planets are Pluto, Haumea, Eris, Ceres and Makemake<br>
2. A celestial body is demoted from planet to dwarf planet when its is <b>not spherical</b>, <i>too small</i> and <u>hasn't completed a full revolution since its discovery</u><br>

<h2 class="h">The Asteroid Belt</h2>
1. It is a donut-shaped cluster of asteroids in between Mars and Jupiter<br>
2. There are approximately 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>5</sub> million asteroids in the belt<br>

<h2 class="h">Meteors</h2>
1. A meteor is a rocky body orbiting Earth<br>
2. They normally originate from the asteroid belt, whether a stray asteroid or chunks of asteroid formed due to a collision with another body.<br>
3. Meteors become <mark><b>meteoroids</b></mark> when they enter the Earth's atmosphere and <mark><b>meteorites</b></mark> when they hit the Earth's surface<br>

<h2 class="h">Comets</h2>
<ol>
  <li>  They are icy bodies that originate from the Oort Cloud<br></li>
<li>The Oort Cloud is the edge of the solar system and consists of approximately 1 quadrillion comets<br></li>
<li>Occasionally, the Sun's gravitational force pulls comets from the Oort Cloud into the inner solar system. However, there is a belief that a body, probably a planet, pushes comets into the inner solar system<br></li>
<li>When comets get too close to the Sun, their icy bodies melt and form tails of water behind them<br></li>
</ol>
